# Smart-Farm-Management-System
Farming sector is very important for human survival that's why in my last semester i did present a project on Smart farming. There are total four sector which cover all necessary activities of a smart farm. The four sector has individual functionalities. The automated water supply system ensure that always water remain on water tank and display real time water level. For that I used ultrasonic distance sensor, water pump and seven segment display. Interactive food supply system give the facilities to supply and control the food supply by using stepper motor, dc motor and switch. Security and safety system ensure the internal safety and security by detecting fire and entry control by using Flame sensor, PIR sensor Buzzer and Security Led. Finally the air circulation and cleaning system help to automatically cleaning and controlling air circulation.
